# scientific-calculator

Just a simply scientific calculator made with decimal.js, with user inserting inputs inside code manually, and seeing results in terminal. There aren't any interfaces. I use it very often in my job, because most of online scientific calculatores, even Linux preinstalled calculator, are innacurate for numbers with a lot of decimals numbers (I usually calculate numbers with 14+ decimal numbers).
